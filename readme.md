This paper shows the viability of using meta-heuristics to faster and more precisely locate RF emitters. The chosen method Power Difference of Arrival, requires a significant amount of computation to estimate an emitter location from sensor readings. By using meta-heuristics, more specifically a variant of Nelder Mead, the computational requirements can halved or even reduced by two orders of magnitude if absolute reliability is not required.
